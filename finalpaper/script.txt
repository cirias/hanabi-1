# Overview
[slide titled "Playing Hanabi with Reinforcement Learning"]

For our final project, we used reinforcement learning to play the card game Hanabi.

# Hanabi

Hanabi is a two-player cooperative card game.

[video of person fanning out a hanabi deck]

A hanabi deck contains a bunch of cards with a number and a color.

Each player is dealt five cards. They can see the other player's cards

[show a hand being held from behind]

but they can't see their own.

[show a pile of played cards]

The goal of the game is to build a stack of cards, one for each color. We get
one point for each card that's played.

The game proceeds in turns. Each turn, a player can do one of three things.

[show card being played]

They can play a card and draw a new card,

[show card being discarded]

they can discard a card and draw a new card,

[show person pointing out cards in other player's hand]

or they can give information about a number or color in their opponent's hand.

[show last card of deck being drawn]

The game proceeds until the deck runs out of cards,

[show last 5 being played]

all the cards are played,

[show information tokens and fuses]

or a couple other things happen, but those aren't important to understand.

[show people playing Hanabi]

The key take away is that the game is cooperative and people don't have
complete information of the game.
