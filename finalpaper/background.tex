Actually hanabi here

Hanabi \cite{hanabiboardgame, hanabiwiki} is a cooperative card game in which two or more players act on partial information towards a common goal. Each player can see the cards of all other players, but not their own. On each turn, a player can play a card (without looking at it), discard a card, or give information to another player. The goal is to play as many cards as possible in a specified order.
