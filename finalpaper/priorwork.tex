%Describe prior approaches here, then compare against them in eval section.

%Prior work \cite{solvinghanabi} has used Hanabi to evaluate the value of
%feedback in cooperative tasks. They showed that they were able to achieve
%a higher score when players were aware of each otherâ€™s strategies, and were
%therefore able to simulate each other. Section \ref{eval} compares our results
%to the prior work.
