\section{Evaluation[Everyone]}\label{sec:eval}

\todo{Write.}
% Give an overview of what we did, and explain what questions we're trying to
% answer.

\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning and Algorithm Selection}
\todo{Write.}
% Show plots of our hyperparameter tuning and discuss which algorithms worked
% best. Make sure to cite the algorithms and maybe describe them?

\subsection{Self Learning vs Guided Learning}
\todo{Write.}
% Show 6 histograms for {hanabi, medium hanabi, mini hanabi} x {dynamic self
% learnt, guided learnt heuristic, guided learnt simple heuristic, static self
% learnt} annotated with mean, median, stdev, etc. Comment on our findings.
% Show a histogram for human performance?

\subsection{Policy Behavior}
\todo{Write.}
% Describe the behavior of various policies and show that the self-learnt one
% behaves differently than the guided learnt one.
