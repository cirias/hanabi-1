\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we presented how to apply reinforcement learning to Hanabi (in
particular) and to cooperative partial information games (in general). We
surveyed how MDP encoding and learning method affect policy performance and
ultimately obtained a mini Hanabi policy that achieves an average of 77\% a
perfect score and outperforms hand-written policies.
